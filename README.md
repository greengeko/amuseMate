With a single tap, discover a world of exciting activities curated to bring joy and fun to your day. From outdoor adventures to creative projects, AmuseMate offers a diverse range of options to suit every mood and occasion.

Note: the current data is mocked with Mockaroo and does not contain real activities, feel free to contribute or clone and adapt to your own necessities.
The activities are suggested by using LightFM Engine integration in MindsDB (https://mindsdb.com/) which base the suggested activity choice on the past user-item ratings.
Some of the activities are marked as "adultContent" and for mock data those would be items 1,2,3. 

## Features

- Disable/Enable activities serverside with major age necessary.
  This was made using Flagsmith (https://www.flagsmith.com/) and the tought behind is to limit the activities based on the user's age.
